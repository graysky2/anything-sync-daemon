.SH NAME
.PP
\f[V]anything-sync-daemon\f[R] - Symlinks and syncs user specified dirs
to RAM thus reducing HDD/SDD calls and speeding-up the system.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[V]anything-sync-daemon\f[R] (\f[V]asd\f[R]) is a tiny pseudo-daemon
designed to manage user-specified directories (referred to as \[lq]sync
targets\[rq] from here on out) in tmpfs and to periodically sync them
back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD).
This is accomplished via a bind-mounting step and an innovative use of
\f[V]rsync\f[R] (https://github.com/WayneD/rsync) to maintain
synchronization between a tmpfs copy and media-bound backups.
Additionally, \f[V]asd\f[R] features several crash-recovery features.
.PP
Design goals of \f[V]asd\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
Completely transparent user experience.
.IP \[bu] 2
Reduced wear to physical discs (particularly SSDs).
.IP \[bu] 2
Speed.
.PP
Since sync targets are relocated into tmpfs (RAM disk), the
corresponding onslaught of I/O associated with their use by the system
is redirected from the physical disc to RAM, reducing wear to the
physical disc and improving speed and responsiveness.
.SH SETUP
.PP
The \f[V]asd\f[R] configuration file contains all user-managed settings.
See the entry on \f[V]ASDCONF\f[R] in the
\f[V]ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\f[R] section for information on the default
\f[V]asd\f[R] configuration file location.
The configuration file location can be overridden by specifying a
pathname in the \f[V]ASDCONF\f[R] environment variable.
For instance, to load \f[V]asd\f[R] settings from
\f[V]/here/for/some/reason/lives/asd.conf\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ ASDCONF=/here/for/some/reason/lives/asd.conf asd <subcommand>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] that edits made to the \f[V]asd\f[R] configuration file
while \f[V]asd\f[R] is running will be applied only after \f[V]asd\f[R]
has been restarted.
.PP
In the \f[V]asd\f[R] configuration file, you may define the following
variables:
.TP
\f[V]WHATTOSYNC\f[R]
A list (more specifically, a Bash array) defining the sync targets for
\f[V]asd\f[R] to manage.
This variable is \f[B]mandatory\f[R].
If you do not define \f[V]WHATTOSYNC\f[R], or if you set it to the empty
list, \f[V]asd\f[R] will complain and bail out.
.TP
\f[V]VOLATILE\f[R]
A path that lives on a tmpfs or zram mount.
This is where \f[V]asd\f[R] will store the data eventually synchronized
back to the physical disk.
By default, when running as \f[V]root\f[R] and \f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS\f[R] is
unset or set to a false value, \f[V]asd\f[R] sets
\f[V]VOLATILE=/tmp\f[R].
Otherwise, \f[V]VOLATILE\f[R] defaults to \f[V]ASDRUNDIR\f[R].
\f[B]Note\f[R] that it is a fatal error to set \f[V]VOLATILE\f[R] to a
path that does not live on a tmpfs or zram mount.
.TP
\f[V]USE_OVERLAYFS\f[R]
A boolean variable controlling whether to use OverlayFS to improve sync
speed even further and use a smaller memory footprint.
\f[B]Note\f[R] that this option requires your kernel to be configured to
use either the \f[V]overlay\f[R] or \f[V]overlayfs\f[R] module.
See the FAQ below for additional details on this feature.
.TP
\f[V]USE_BACKUPS\f[R]
A boolean variable controlling whether to create crash-recovery
snapshots.
.TP
\f[V]BACKUP_LIMIT\f[R]
An unsigned integer defining the number of crash-recovery snapshots to
keep.
.TP
\f[V]DEBUG\f[R]
A boolean variable controlling whether to issue debugging output.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] that the default values of
\f[V]/tmp\f[R]/\f[V]ASDRUNDIR\f[R] should work just fine for the
\f[V]VOLATILE\f[R] setting.
If using \f[V]bleachbit\f[R] (https://www.bleachbit.org/), do NOT invoke
it with the \f[V]--clean system.tmp\f[R] switch or you will remove a key
dot file (\f[V].foo\f[R]) from \f[V]/tmp\f[R] that \f[V]asd\f[R] needs
to keep track of sync status.
Also note that using a value of \f[V]/dev/shm\f[R] can cause problems
with systemd\[cq]s \f[V]NAMESPACE\f[R] spawning only when users enable
the OverlayFS option.

.SH RUNNING ASD
.SS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
\f[V]asd\f[R] recognizes the following environment variables:
.TP
\f[V]ASDCONF\f[R]
Path to the \f[V]asd\f[R] configuration file.
Defaults to \f[V]/etc/asd.conf\f[R] when \f[V]asd\f[R] is running as
\f[V]root\f[R] and \f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS\f[R] is unset or set to a false
value; otherwise, defaults to \f[V]${ASDCONFDIR}/asd.conf\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS\f[R]
A boolean variable controlling whether to use \[lq]version 1\[rq] paths
or not.
When set to a false value, \f[V]asd\f[R] will use old-style defaults for
its daemon file (\f[V]/run/asd\f[R]), lock file
(\f[V]/run/asd-lock\f[R]), and configuration file
(\f[V]/etc/asd.conf\f[R]).
\f[B]NOTE\f[R] that this variable is ignored when \f[V]asd\f[R] is
running as a non-\f[V]root\f[R] user.
Defaults to disabled (effectively, \f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS=0\f[R]).
.TP
\f[V]ASDCONFDIR\f[R]
Parent directory of \f[V]asd.conf\f[R] if \f[V]ASDCONF\f[R] is not
defined.
Ignored when running as \f[V]root\f[R] and \f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS\f[R] is
unset or set to a false value.
Otherwise, defaults to the first (leftmost) of the colon-separated paths
in the \f[V]CONFIGURATION_DIRECTORY\f[R] environment variable (which is
set when \f[V]asd\f[R] runs under systemd and the \f[V]asd.service\f[R]
unit defines at least one \f[V]ConfigurationDirectory\f[R] entry),
falling back to \f[V]/etc/asd\f[R] when running as \f[V]root\f[R] and
\f[V]${XDG_CONFIG_DIR}/asd\f[R] when running as a non-\f[V]root\f[R]
user.
.TP
\f[V]ASDRUNDIR\f[R]
Directory where \f[V]asd\f[R] should store runtime state.
Ignored when running as \f[V]root\f[R] and \f[V]ASDNOV1PATHS\f[R] is
unset or set to a false value.
Otherwise, defaults to the first (leftmost) of the colon-separated paths
in the \f[V]RUNTIME_DIRECTORY\f[R] (which is set when \f[V]asd\f[R] runs
under systemd and the \f[V]asd.service\f[R] unit defines at least one
\f[V]RuntimeDirectory\f[R] entry), falling back to \f[V]/run/asd\f[R]
when running as \f[V]root\f[R] and \f[V]${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/asd\f[R] when
running as a non-\f[V]root\f[R] user.
.TP
\f[V]ASDCONFTIMEOUT\f[R]
\f[V]asd\f[R] enforces a limit on how long it takes to load
\f[V]asd.conf\f[R].
By default, that limit is 10 seconds.
You may influence this timeout by setting \f[V]ASDCONFTIMEOUT\f[R] to a
duration expression recognized by your system\[cq]s implementation of
the \f[V]timeout\f[R] command.
For instance, you could set \f[V]ASDCONFTIMEOUT=30\f[R] to allow
\f[V]asd.conf\f[R] loading to take 30 seconds, or set
\f[V]ASDCONFTIMEOUT=1m\f[R] to allow one minute.
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[R] that, with the exception of \f[V]WHATTOSYNC\f[R], all
variables recognized in \f[V]asd.conf\f[R] can be specified as
environment variables.
However, these environment variables will be overridden if there are any
conflicting definitions in \f[V]asd.conf\f[R].
.SS PREVIEW MODE
.PP
The preview option can be called to show users exactly what
\f[V]asd\f[R] will do/is doing based on the entries in the \f[V]asd\f[R]
configuration file as well as print useful information such as directory
size, paths, and data about any recovery snapshots that have been
created.

Note that for these init systems, the supplied cron script (installed to
\f[V]/etc/cron.hourly\f[R]) will run the resync option to keep the tmpfs
copies synchronized.
Of course, the target system must have cron installed and active for
this to happen.

.SH FAQ
.SS Q1: What is \[lq]OverlayFS mode\[rq]?
.SS A1:
.PP
OverlayFS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS) is a simple union
filesystem mainlined in the Linux kernel version 3.18.0.
Starting with \f[V]asd\f[R] version 5.54, OverlayFS can be used to
reduce the memory footprint of \f[V]asd\f[R]\[cq]s tmpfs space and to
speed up sync and unsync operations.
The magic is in how the overlay mount only writes out data that has
changed rather than writing out the entire sync target.
The same recovery features \f[V]asd\f[R] uses in its default mode are
also active when running in OverlayFS mode.
OverlayFS mode is enabled by setting the \f[V]USE_OVERLAYFS\f[R]
variable to a truthy value (e.g.\ \f[V]USE_OVERLAYFS=1\f[R]) in the
\f[V]asd\f[R] configuration (followed by a restart of the daemon if
\f[V]asd\f[R] is already active).
.PP
There are several versions of OverlayFS available to the Linux kernel in
production in various distros.
Versions 22 and lower have a module called \f[V]overlayfs\f[R] while
newer versions (23 and higher) have a module called \f[V]overlay\f[R]
\[en] note the lack of the \[lq]fs\[rq] in the newer version.
\f[V]asd\f[R] will automatically detect the OverlayFS version available
to your kernel when \f[V]USE_OVERLAYFS\f[R] is enabled.
.PP
See the example in the \[lq]PREVIEW MODE\[rq] section above which shows
a system using OverlayFS to illustrate the memory savings that can be
achieved.
Note the \[lq]overlayfs size\[rq] report compared to the total \[lq]dir
size\[rq] report for each sync target.
Be aware that these numbers will change depending on just how much data
is written to the sync target, but in common use cases, the OverlayFS
size will always be less than the dir size.
.SS Q2: Why do I see the directories \f[V].foo-backup_asd\f[R] and \f[V].foo-backup_asd-old\f[R]?
.SS A2:
.PP
The \f[V]asd\f[R] backup process works by creating a hard-linked clone
of the original directory; this is known as
\f[V].foo-backup_asd-old\f[R].
The other \f[V].foo-backup_asd\f[R] is just a bind mount to the original
directory link which is used to access the contents of the original
directory for overlay purposes.
.SS Q3: My system crashed and \f[V]asd\f[R] didn\[cq]t sync back. What do I do?
.SS A3:
.PP
The \[lq]last good\[rq] backup of your sync targets is just fine still
sitting happily on your filesystem.
Upon restarting \f[V]asd\f[R] (on a reboot for example), a check is
preformed to see if \f[V]asd\f[R] was exited in some corrupted state.
If it is detected, \f[V]asd\f[R] will snapshot the \[lq]last good\[rq]
backup before it rotates it back into place.
Note that, since \f[V]asd\f[R] tries to decrease the disk usage, it
never really \[lq]copies\[rq] the full contents of the directory and
just uses the hardlinks to the previous files.
And during the \f[V]rsync\f[R] step, it creates new files so that the
previous hardlinks are untouched.
So trying to modify the directory during the time \f[V]asd\f[R] is
trying to backup can leave the directory in some corrupted state.
.SS Q4: Where can I find the crash-recovery snapshot?
.SS A4:
.PP
You will find the snapshot in the same directory as the sync target.
It will contain a \f[V]<date>_<time>\f[R] suffix that corresponds to the
time at which the recovery took place.
For example, a \f[V]/foo/bar\f[R] snapshot will have a path like
\f[V]/foo/.bar-backup_asd-crashrecovery-20141221_070112.tar.zstd\f[R]
\[en] of course, the \f[V]<date>_<time>\f[R] suffix will be different
for you.
.SS Q5: How can I restore the crash-recovery snapshot?
.SS A5:
.PP
Follow these steps:
.IP "1." 3
Stop \f[V]asd\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Confirm that the directories created by \f[V]asd\f[R] are not present.
If they are, \f[V]asd\f[R] did not stop correctly for other reasons.
.IP "3." 3
Move the \[lq]bad\[rq] copy of the sync taget to a backup (don\[cq]t
blindly delete anything).
.IP "4." 3
Untar the snapshot directory to the expected sync target.
.PP
Example using \f[V]/foo/bar\f[R] under systemd:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# systemctl stop asd.service
# cd /foo
# mv bar bar-bad
# tar -xvf .bar-backup_asd-crashrecovery-20141221_070112.tar.zstd
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
At this point, check that everything is fine with the data on
\f[V]/foo/bar\f[R].
If all is well, it is safe to delete the snapshot.
.SS Q6: Can \f[V]asd\f[R] delete the snapshots automatically?
.SS A6:
.PP
Yes, run \f[V]asd\f[R] with the \f[V]clean\f[R] switch to delete
snapshots.
See the \[lq]CLEAN MODE\[rq] section for details.
