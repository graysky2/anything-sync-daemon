WARNING
To avoid data loss, it is HIGHLY recommended that users stop any running
versions of this software before install updates. Internal changes are
always possible from one release to another.

BUILDING
 Setup the script via a make.

 $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to the file-
 system.  Most users will want to select from one or the other of the following
 options depending on target init system (do not run both)!

  # make install-systemd-all
  # make install-upstart-all

 As of v3.13, the Makefiles for systemd-native distros such as Arch, Exherbo,
 and Fedora, no longer install the deprecated cron script, and instead install
 a systemd timer unit. Users may override and install the deprecated cron
 script by running make with `install-with-cron` instead  of `install` at this
 point.
