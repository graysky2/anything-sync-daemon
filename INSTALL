BUILDING
 Setup the via a make.

 $ make

 Running a `make install-xxx` as root will distribute the files to the file-
 system.  Most users will want to select from three options depending on target
 init system (do not run both)!

  # make install-systemd-all
  # make install-upstart-all

 As of v3.13, the Makefiles for systemd-native distros such as Arch, Exherbo,
 and Fedora, no longer install the deprecated cron script using a systemd
 timer instead. Users may override and install the deprecated cron script by
 running make with `install-with-cron` instead  of `install` at this point.
