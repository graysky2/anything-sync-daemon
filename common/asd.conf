# Define the target(s) directories in the WHATTOSYNC array
# Do NOT define a file! These MUST be directories with an absolute path!
#
# Note that the target DIRECTORIES and all subdirs under them will be included
# In other words, this is recursive
#
# Below is an example to whet your appetite
#WHATTOSYNC=('/srv/http' '/var/lib/monitorix' '/foo/bar')
WHATTOSYNC=()

# Define where data will reside in tmpfs
# Think hard about this if using utils like bleachbit as it has a nasty habit
# of nuking files it identifies as junk in /tmp
#
# A safer location for things is actually /dev/shm
#
# This location must be mounted to tmpfs and MUST be writable and executable
# for the user
# Use NO trailing backslash!
#VOLATILE="/dev/shm"

# Uncomment to use an overlayfs instead of a full copy to reduce the memory costs and
# to improve sync/unsync operations.
#
# You must modprobe either the 'overlayfs' or 'overlay' module prior to running asd if
# you enable this option. Distros running the linux kernel version >=3.18.0 are likely
# using the 'overlay' module while some distros shipping older kernels, notably Ubuntu
# provide the older version of this technology which is provided in the 'overlayfs'
# module not 'overlay' module.
#USE_OVERLAYFS="yes"
