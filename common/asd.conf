## WARNING Do NOT edit anything in this file while asd is running!
## To protect data from corruption, in the event that you do make an edit
## while asd is active, any changes made will be applied the next time
## you start-up asd.

# Define the target(s) directories in the WHATTOSYNC array
# Do NOT define a file! These MUST be directories with an absolute path!
#
# Note that the target DIRECTORIES and all subdirs under them will be included
# In other words, this is recursive
#
# Below is an example to whet your appetite
#WHATTOSYNC=('/srv/http' '/var/lib/monitorix' '/foo/bar')
WHATTOSYNC=()

# Define where data will reside in tmpfs
# Think hard about this if using utils like bleachbit as it has a nasty habit
# of nuking files it identifies as junk in /tmp
#
# A safer location for things is actually /dev/shm
#
# This location must be mounted to tmpfs and MUST be writable and executable
# for the user
# Use NO trailing backslash!
#VOLATILE="/dev/shm"

# Uncomment and set to yes to use an overlayfs instead of a full copy to reduce
# the memory costs and to improve sync/unsync operations.
#
# You must modprobe either the 'overlayfs' or 'overlay' module prior to running asd if
# you enable this option. Distros running the linux kernel version >=3.18.0 are likely
# using the 'overlay' module while some distros shipping older kernels, notably Ubuntu
# provide the older version of this technology which is provided in the 'overlayfs'
# module not 'overlay' module.
#USE_OVERLAYFS="no"

# Uncomment and set to no to completely disable the crash recovery feature of asd.
#
# The default is to create crash recovery backups if the system is ungracefully
# powered-down due to a kernel panic, hitting the reset switch, battery going
# dead, etc. Some users keep very diligent backups and don't care to have this
# feature enabled.
#USE_BACKUPS="yes"
