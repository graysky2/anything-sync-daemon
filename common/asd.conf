## To protect data from corruption, in the event that you do make an edit
## while asd is active, any changes made will be applied the next time
## you start-up asd.

# Define the target(s) directories in the WHATTOSYNC array.
# Do NOT define a file! These MUST be directories with an absolute path.
#
# Note that the target DIRECTORIES and all subdirs under them will be included.
# In other words, this is recursive.
#
# Below is an example to whet your appetite.
#WHATTOSYNC=('/srv/http' '/var/lib/monitorix' '/foo/bar')
WHATTOSYNC=()

# Define where data will reside in tmpfs.
# This location must be mounted to tmpfs and MUST be writable and executable.
#
# If using bleachbit, do NOT invoke it with the '--clean system.tmp' switch or
# you will remove a key dot file (.foo) from /tmp that asd needs to keep track
# of sync status.
#
# Note that using a value of '/dev/shm' can cause problems with systemd's
# NAMESPACE spawning only when users enable the overlayfs option.

#VOLATILE="/tmp"

# ASD can break hardlinks present in the system, it has a safety check to ensure
# that the synced directories don't have the presence of any hardlinks in them
# by default, incase you want the directory to work standalone
# and not affect any other hardlinks of the files present in the synced directory,
# you can disable this safety check
# ENABLE_HARDLINK_SAFETY_CHECK=1

# Uncomment and set to yes to use an overlayfs instead of a full copy to reduce
# the memory costs and to improve sync/unsync operations.
#
# You must modprobe either the 'overlayfs' or 'overlay' module prior to running asd if
# you enable this option. Distros running the linux kernel version >=3.18.0 are likely
# using the 'overlay' module while some distros shipping older kernels, notably Ubuntu
# provide the older version of this technology which is provided in the 'overlayfs'
# module not 'overlay' module.
#USE_OVERLAYFS="no"

# Uncomment and set to no to completely disable the crash recovery feature of asd.
#
# The default is to create crash recovery backups if the system is ungracefully
# powered-down due to a kernel panic, hitting the reset switch, battery going
# dead, etc. Some users keep very diligent backups and don't care to have this
# feature enabled.
#USE_BACKUPS="yes"

# Uncomment and set to an integer that is the maximum number of crash recovery
# snapshots to keep (the oldest ones are delete first).
#
# The default is to save the most recent 5 crash recovery snapshots.
#BACKUP_LIMIT=5
